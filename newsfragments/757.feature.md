Allow to call trait methods on types when trait is in scope

So far traits were only useful as bounds for generic functions.
With this change traits can also be used as illustrated with
the following example:

```
trait Double {
  fn double(self) -> u256;
}

impl Double for (u256, u256) {
  fn double(self) -> u256 {
    return (self.item0 + self.item1) * 2
  }
}

contract Example {

  pub fn run_test(self) {
    assert (0, 1).double() == 2
  }
}
```

If a call turns out to be ambigious the compiler currently asks the
user to disambiguate via renaming. In the future we will likely
introduce a syntax to allow to disambiguate at the callsite.
